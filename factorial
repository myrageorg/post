# Program to find the factorial

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage of the program

# Ask the user for a number to calculate the factorial
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is non-negative
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial of a negative number is not defined.")
else:
    # Call the factorial function and print the result
    print("Factorial of", num, ":", factorial(num))
